# Metaverso

> A more usable Emacs without complicated customizations

Metaverso is my effort to make an Emacs distribution with a modern look without adding too many complicated mechanisms. There are many others that are great when you only want to use them, but are confusing when you want to modify themâ€”even just to install packages.
